Creating/running the tests in this package:

* Define the following properties in your local maven settings.xml as part of a webtests profile:
	- admin.url -> URL of host to run admintests against
	- admin.user -> self explanatory
	- admin.password -> self explanatory
	- view.url -> URL of host to run "normal" tests (viewtests) against
	- webdav.url -> URL of host to run webdavtests against
	- Like so:
	
	<profiles>
	  ...
	  
	  <profile>
        <id>webtests</id>
        <properties>
          <admin.url>xxx</admin.url>
          <admin.user>xxx</admin.user>
          <admin.password>xxx</admin.password>
          <view.url>xxx</view.url>
          <webdav.url>xxx</webdav.url>
        </properties>
      </profile>
      
      ...
    </profiles>
	

# TODO: HOW TO AUTOMIZE THIS?
* Create required resources on host that tests are to run against:
	- Rootcollection with name "automatedtestresources", all other testresources are created in here
	- One collectionfolder per testcase, with the same name as the testclass in lowercase
	- Make sure the collection contains resources/files that are relevant to the testcase

* Create tests by extending one of the following:
	- BaseAuthenticatedWebTest -> for tests that require authentication (package admin)
	- BaseWebTest -> for "normal" tests (viewtests) (package view)
	- BaseWebdavWebTest -> for webdav tests (package webdav)

* NB! Tests should be created in one of the following subpackages:
	- org.vortikal.integration.webtests.admin
	- org.vortikal.integration.webtests.view
	- org.vortikal.integration.webtests.webdav

* Run the tests (as integration tests) with maven using the "webtests" profile:
	- mvn -Pwebtests integration-test
	- The profile will NOT run Abstract*.java or Base*.java, ONLY *Test.java
