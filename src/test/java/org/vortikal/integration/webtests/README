Creating/running the tests in this package:

# TODO: RECONSIDER THIS???
* Resources for the tests are created and setup using createArchiveService and expandArchiveService
	- A resourcebundle (automatedtestresources.jar) is located under test/resources/integration/webtests
	- Expand the bundle using the expandArchiveService under the rootfolder of the instance to run the tests against
	- If you create new tests, make sure you update the resourcebundle at the same time using the createArchiveService
	- NB!! Create resources for new tests with the same user as the one used in the bundle.

* Manually creating required resources on host that tests are to run against:
	- Rootcollection with name AND title declared as property webtests.rootcollection in webtests.properties,
	  default is "automatedtestresources", all other testresources are created in here
	- One collectionfolder per testcase, with the same name AND title as the testclass in lowercase
	- Make sure the collection contains resources/files that are relevant to the testcase

* Create tests by extending one of the following:
	- BaseAuthenticatedWebTest -> for tests that require authentication (package admin)
	- BaseWebTest -> for "normal" tests (viewtests) (package view)
	- BaseWebdavWebTest -> for webdav tests (package webdav)

* NB! Tests should be created in one of the following subpackages:
	- org.vortikal.integration.webtests.admin
	- org.vortikal.integration.webtests.view
	- org.vortikal.integration.webtests.webdav

* Run the tests (as integration tests) with maven using the "webtests" profile:
	- mvn -Pwebtests integration-test
	- The profile will NOT run Abstract*.java or Base*.java, ONLY *Test.java
