Creating/running the tests in this package:

* Create (in your home folder) and add proper values to vrtx-automatedtest.properties:
	- adminUrl -> URL of host to run admintests against
	- adminUser -> self explanatory
	- adminPassword -> self explanatory
	- viewUrl -> URL of host to run "normal" tests (viewtests) against
	- webdavUrl -> URL of host to run webdavtests against

# HOW TO AUTOMIZE THIS???
* Create required resources on host that tests are to run against:
	- Rootcollection with name AND title "automatedtestresources", all other testresources are created in here
	- One collectionfolder per testcase, with the same name AND title as the testclass in lowercase
	- Make sure the collection contains resources/files that are relevant to the testcase

* Create tests by extending one of the following:
	- AuthenticatedWebTest -> for tests that require authentication (package admin)
	- WebTest -> for "normal" tests (viewtests) (package view)
	- WebdavWebTest -> for webdav tests (package webdav)

* NB! Tests should be created in one of the following subpackages:
	- org.vortikal.integration.webtests.admin
	- org.vortikal.integration.webtests.view
	- org.vortikal.integration.webtests.webdav

* Run the tests (as integration tests) with maven using the "webtests" profile:
	- mvn -Pwebtests integration-test
	- The profile will NOT run Abstract* or *WebTest.java, ONLY *Test.java
