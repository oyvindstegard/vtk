    This package is the core spring web application framework extension.

      TODO:

      <li>How is the guessing of url constructing to be specified</li>
    </ul>
      
    <p>
      This package is a simple abstraction layer on top of the Spring's 
      standard and flexible webapp framework, to support our resource centric
      approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      When generating user views, we often want to create links to more or 
      less specific functionality or views on resources (i.e. a link to a resource' 
      general administration page, deletion or a certain modification of a child 
      resource). This kind of dependencies between functionality are usually
      just handled within the scope of the "application" (where each application has it's own uri),
      and are the (application centric) developers' responsibility. For web and document centric 
      web applications this isn't a good solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The core of this package is the Service, a plain data holder. A service can have a list of child 
      services, effectively making a tree of services. Each service can have a list of assertions, 
      a standard Spring Controller and a set of name->View mappings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The service is not as plain as it might seem. Usually the task of dividing complex 
      functionality into manageble parts, is done by creating isolated applications where 
      each again has divided the functionality into pages, views, actions or whatever. The service 
      in our framework is a simple generic and flexible replacement for this kind of two (or more)-level 
      approach, making it possible to define abstract or concrete grouping of functionality 
      anyway you like. With the flexible assertion concept we're no longer bound to the use of 
      the uri namespace to divide functionality into logical toplevel applications (or pages). This 
      makes it possible to give the user a document- and web centric experience, a widely known and 
      understood metaphore for computer and web use. 
    </p>
    <p>
      With the helper class LinkConstructor, a service is able to construct URLs 
      to itself, based on a given resource and principal, and the assertions in the service tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      An assertion states a fact that must be true (for the service it's referenced from).
      It might say that the uri prefix must be "/sweet/16" or that the host name must be "localhost".
      But it could also state that the resource on the specified uri must be a folder or an XML document
      with a specific schema definition. As long as the implementation can resolve the assertion based 
      on the request, resource or principal, there's no limitations on what can be asserted.   
    </p>    
    <p>
      Two classes, the ServiceHandlerMapping and the 
      ServiceViewResolver takes a service tree as a property to perform two distinct framework
      tasks; handler mapping and view resolving.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The ServiceHandlerMapping</b> is a standard Spring HandlerMapping. Starting at the service 
      root it checks any assertions set on this service. If any fails it returns null (no match).
      If there are no assertions or all assertions passes, it goes through all child services 
      (if there are any) recursively. The first child to return a controller ends the recursion, 
      giving a simple depth first traversal of the service tree. If none of the children returns 
      a controller, this service' controller (if it has any) is returned. 
    </p>   
    <p>
      In other words, you place your controllers in a service tree with associated assertions,
      returning the last controller found (if any) along the first depth first traversal where all
      assertions match.
    </p>  
    <p><b>The ServiceViewResolver</b> can be used, as all view resolvers, to map logical view 
      name to a View. It checks the current service (if any) to see if this name is specified in
      the name->View map. If it doesn't, it traverses up the service tree to see if the name is 
      specified in any of the ancestors.
    </p>
    <p>This is a convenient way to easily add custom functionality. Often new functionality is
      added for a rare case, where you want a specific view to be overrided or a new one added, 
      without changing the logical name of this view or any other view. In a large service tree,
      keeping tabs on unique but still meaningful logical view names, and avoid having to change 
      the hard coded String values in code, can be a mess. This mechanism gives us the ability to
      group the views to the logical services, without loosing any flexibility.
