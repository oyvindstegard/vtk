This directory contains Freemarker templates that are complete HTML
pages (pages that should be self-contained and work stand-alone
without any layout wrapping).

This is an example of a layout wrapping: 
                                            
                                             -------------- 
 --------------                             |    head      |
|              |                             -------------- 
|              |                            |    header    |
|  HTML-page   |   --- layout-wrapping -->   --------------
|              |                            |              |
|              |                            |  Modified    |
|              |                            |  HTML-page   |
 --------------                             |              |
                                             -------------- 
                                            |    footer    |
                                             -------------- 


The original HTML page is expected to be well-formed (as content is
inserted in the <head> and <body> elements.
