 * and asynchronous refresh and warmup. It uses round-robin or optionally thread-sticky
 * hand-out of readers if pool size > 1.
 *
 * Refresh of <code>IndexReader</code> instances is done asynchronously in background
 * threads to avoid blocking callers. While refreshing, <code>IndexReader</code>
 * instances can be optionally warmed up by 
 * (warmup details delegated to a configured <code>IndexReaderWarmup</code> instance).
 *
