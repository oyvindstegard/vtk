  <h1>Resource and property types</h1>

  <h2>Resource types</h2>

<p>Every resource has a type. The repository is configured with a
resource type tree, defining the possible resource types, their
respective characteristics and the constraints imposed for a resource
to be considered of this type.</p>

<h3>Resource type characteristics</h3>

<p>Except for the root resource type, which all resources is considered
to be of, all resource types must have a parent resource type and a
(possibly empty) set of assertions which define what characteristics
is required of a resource to be considered of this type.</p>

<p>A resource type may define a set of repository controlled
properties. These properties are explained below.</p>

<p>In addition to the primary resource type parent, a resource type can
identify a set of mixin resource types. Mixin resource types is
limited resource types, only containing property definitions and mixin
resource types. The properties defined in a mixin, is considered part
of the resource type in the same way as locally defined proerties.</p>

<h2>Property types</h2>

<p>Resources can have a unlimited of properties attached to
it. Properties is identified by the combination of a namespace and a
name and the property value can be any string value.</p>

<p>Property types defined in the resource type tree, adds repository
controlled characteristics on the value of a specific namespace:name 
identified property. Some of characteristics that can be controlled:</p>

<ul>
<li>All defined property types, will be indexed for resources of the specified type, 
	and can be queried on and will be reported in query results</li>
<li>The value can be of one of the types, either single or multivalue:
  <ul>
    <li>String</li>
    <li>Integer</li>
    <li>Long</li>
    <li>Date</li>
    <li>Boolean</li>
    <li>Principal</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Specify who is allowed to edit the property</li>
<li>Specify a controlled vocabulary of allowed values</li>
<li>Specify repository controlled live updating of the property</li>
<li>Define property to be mandatory</li>
</ul>
