/**
 * A Lucene <code>Filter</code> that filters on the given wildcard term.
 * 
 * @see org.apache.lucene.search.WildcardTermEnum
 * 
 * NOTE: This filter is only meant as a short-lived filter for a single query.
 *       The results are cached once, and only once, and applies to the reader
 *       that was passed in after the first call to {@link #bits(IndexReader)}.
 *       Sub-sequent calls with different readers will not update the cached
 *       results ! So don't re-use instances of this class.
 *       
 *       Not thread safe (common usage scenario doesn't require this).
 *       
 *       Long-term filters which rarely change should be wrapped with
 *       {@link org.apache.lucene.search.CachingWrapperFilter} instead.
