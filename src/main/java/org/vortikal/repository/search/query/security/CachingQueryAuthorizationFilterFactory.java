/**
 * A filter-factory which does caching of filters.
 * 
 * Currently, global caching is only done for ACL read for all filter.
 * Per principal ACL filters are cached only through-out a single request thread.
 *
 * The cached filter bits are keyed on IndexReader instance, so old bitsets are automatically
 * discarded when a new index reader instance is used. This is
 * done in {@link CachingWrapperFilter}. A <code>Map</code> with weak keys
 * is used internally, so it does not leak old <code>IndexReader</code> references.
