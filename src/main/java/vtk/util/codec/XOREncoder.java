/**
 * Simple XOR string encoder/decoder.
 *
 * This class does not provide real security unless the key used is truly random
 * and of at least the same length as the data being encoded, AND that the value
 * being encoded is not possible to guess.
 *
 * Preferably key should be longer than, or at least as long as the data to be encoded
 * using the key (key must be one byte at minimum).
 *
 * Note again that the key can easily be derived from the encoded data if the value
 * that the encoded data represents is known or can be guessed by third party.
 *
 * Useful mostly for obfuscation purposes. Don't use this class if real security
 * is required.
