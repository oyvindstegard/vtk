/**
 * Simple HTTP Status code view.
 * 
 * Expects the model to contain a property 
 * <code>WebdavConstants.WEBDAVMODEL_HTTP_STATUS_CODE</code> containing an 
 * <code>Integer</code> object with the desired status code.
 * 
 * FIXME: some WebDAV status codes are not recognized by servlet container, and
 * so the message "Internal Server Error" is appended. An example of this is
 * "423 Locked", which is returned to clients as "423 Internal Server Error".
 * The method HttpServletResponse.setStatus(int sc, String msg) is deprecated, 
 * and the API suggests using HttpServletResponse.sendError(int sc, String msg) 
 * instead. A solution might be to check if status code is >= 400, and if so, then
 * use HttpServletResponse.sendError(sc, "Our WebDAV status message from HttpUtil").
