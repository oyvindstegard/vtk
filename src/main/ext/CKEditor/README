Integration of CKEditor in VTK

----------------------------------------------

http://www.ckeditor.com/

For the CKEditor license, see

ckeditor-org/ckeditor-<version>/license.txt

----------------------------------------------


This directory contains three sub-directories:

  o ckeditor-org: the original distribution(s) of FCKEditor
  o ckeditor-modifications: the local source modifications
  o ckeditor-build: the resulting "merge" between
    ckeditor-org/<ck-version> and ckeditor-modifications.

All local modifications should be made in ckeditor-modifications and
then copied to ckeditor-build (or the other way around :)

No modifications should be made in ckeditor-org.

Check that /plugins/table/dialogs/table.js is not updated or you have to delete it from modifications,
and add the modifications to the new version after, or it will be out-of-sync.

Upgrading to a new version:

cd src/main/ext/CKeditor
wget http://.../CKeditor_<version>.zip
unzip CKeditor_<version>.zip
mv ckeditor ckeditor-org/ckeditor-<version>
rsync -r --delete -ptv ckeditor-org/ckeditor-<version>/ ckeditor-build
rsync -r -ptv ckeditor-modifications/ ckeditor-build


Obs: New image2-plugin requires that this is exact code is inserted into ckeditor.js in ckeditor-build/
CKEDITOR.plugins.div.getSurroundDiv(a).$.className.indexOf("vrtx-img-container ")!==-1||CKEDITOR.plugins.div.getSurroundDiv(a).$.className.indexOf("vrtx-container ")!==-1?{removediv:CKEDITOR.TRISTATE_OFF}:

Directly after this code-snippet (copy/paste the line above directly after "?"):
b.isReadOnly()?null:CKEDITOR.plugins.div.getSurroundDiv(a)?

(otherwise need to build plugins/div/plugin.js into ckeditor.js)

If it doesn't work (which can mean the language-files have been updated in new version)
you have to copy mediaembed{} from the language-files en.js and no.js: 

  o ckeditor-org/<ck-version>/lang/ => ckeditor-modifications/lang/
  o ckeditor-org/<ck-version>/_source/lang/ => ckeditor-modifications/_source/lang/
