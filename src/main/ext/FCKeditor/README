Integration of FCKEditor in Vortikal

http://www.fckeditor.net/

This directory contains three sub-directories:

  o fckeditor-org: the original distribution(s) of FCKEditor
  o fckeditor-modifications: the local source modifications
  o fckeditor-build: the resulting "merge" between the previous
    directories.

All local modifications should be made in fckeditor-modifications and
then copied to fckeditor-build (or the other way around :) 

No modifications should be made in fckeditor-org.

For the FCKEditor license, see 

fckeditor-org/fckeditor-<version>/license.txt
