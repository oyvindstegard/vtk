Integration of FCKEditor in Vortikal

----------------------------------------------

http://www.fckeditor.net/

For the FCKEditor license, see

fckeditor-org/fckeditor-<version>/license.txt

----------------------------------------------


This directory contains three sub-directories:

  o fckeditor-org: the original distribution(s) of FCKEditor
  o fckeditor-modifications: the local source modifications
  o fckeditor-build: the resulting "merge" between
    fckeditor-org/<fck-version> and fckeditor-modifications.

All local modifications should be made in fckeditor-modifications and
then copied to fckeditor-build (or the other way around :)

No modifications should be made in fckeditor-org.

To compress/package the editor (must be performed whenever changes are
made):

cd fckeditor-build
for f in $(svn status ../fckeditor-modifications | grep '^M ' | sed 's/M .*\.\.\/fckeditor-modifications\///'); do cp "../fckeditor-modifications/$f" "./$f"; done;

php ./fckpackager.php

The fckpackager.php file can be downloaded from:

http://svn.fckeditor.net/FCKpackager/trunk/fckpackager.php



Upgrading to a new version:

cd src/main/ext/FCKeditor
wget http://.../FCKeditor_<version>.tar.gz
tar zcvf FCKeditor_<version>.tar.gz
mv -r fckeditor fckeditor-org/fckeditor-<version>
rsync -r --exclude .svn\*  --exclude fckpackager.php --exclude custom-fckconfig.js --delete -ptv fckeditor-org/fckeditor-<version>/ fckeditor-build

for f in $(svn status fckeditor-build | grep \! | awk '{print $2}'); do svn rm "$f"; done

for f in $(svn status fckeditor-build | grep \? | awk '{print $2}'); do svn add "$f"; done

<merge files from fckeditor-modifications into fckeditor-build>
