      <!-- add 'action' entries here, newest on top: -->

      <action dev="gormap" type="add">
        Added RequestURIRegexpWrappingAssertion, for selectively
        applying assertions based on regular expression matching on
        the request URI. One use case for such an assertion is to
        require that certain subtrees in the URI space are only
        accessible through https.
      </action>

      <action dev="storset" type="add">
        Added LinkConstructor as an optional parameter to xsl
        transformation with ResourceXsltView. This makes it possible
        to create links from within xsl.
      </action>

      <action dev="storset" type="fix">
        Refactored/bug fixed getAbsolutePath() in
        AbstractPathBasedURIResolver. Not extensively tested.
      </action>

      <action dev="gormap" type="update">
        It is now possible for services to 'hook into' another service
        trough a new category-based lookup system, avoiding the need
        to explicitly refer to child services from an existing
        service. (As a consequence, services may now belong to more
        than one category.)
      </action>

      <action dev="gormap" type="update">
        Added refresh functionality to the document templates listing
        component for creating new documents.
      </action>

      <action dev="gormap" type="update">
        Improved character encoding for HTML documents in plaintext
        editing component. Now checks actual HTML content for meta
        tags if no character encoding is set on the resource itself.
