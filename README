To set up a minimal version of the Vortikal server the following steps
are necessary:

1. Create a database using the DDL in the
   'src/sql/postgresql-schema.sql' (currently only PostgreSQL is
   supported, but HSQLDB has also been known to work in the past).

2. Create a 'build.properties' file in this directory containing (at a
   minimum) these properties:

   jdbcUsername = <your JDBC user>
   jdbcPassword = <your JDBC password>
   databaseURL = <your JDBC URL, e.g. jdbc:postgresql:my-user>
   repositoryDataDirectory = <an empty directory for storing files>
   systemIndexPath = <an empty directory for storing indexes>

3. Run the command 'maven war:webapp' (standing in the project
   directory).

4. Start resin2 using the configuration file in
   'target/resin.conf'. If you want to run with resin3 a the following
   property to build.properties before running 'maven war:webapp':

   resin3 = true

5. You should now be able to access the web service on
   http:localhost:9322/ and the WebDAV service on
   http://localhost:9321/. Log in as 'root@localhost:fish'.

6. See the default configuration file 'conf/beans/vortikal.properties'
   for descriptions of the various configuration settings.
