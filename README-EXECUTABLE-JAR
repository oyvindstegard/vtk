To build an executable jar:

$ mvn package spring-boot:repackage

(Results in a file target/vtk-<version>.jar)

To run (minimal setup):

1. Create a minimal config file, for example ~/vtk.properties:

   indexStorageRootPath = [an empty directory for storing indices]
   jdbcUsername = [your JDBC user]
   jdbcPassword = [your JDBC password]
   repositoryDataDirectory = [an empty directory for storing files]
   repositoryTrashCanDirectory = [an empty directory for storing "deleted" files]
   repositoryRevisionDirectory = [an empty directory for storing file revisions]
   databaseURL = [your JDBC URL, e.g. jdbc:postgresql:my-user>]

2. Run the application:

./run-boot.sh --jar target/vtk-<version>.jar

If you want give a load balancer a chance to finish the requests it has queued for the app.

./run-boot.sh --jar target/vtk-<version>.jar --graceful[=n]

n is the time to wait in seconds.
