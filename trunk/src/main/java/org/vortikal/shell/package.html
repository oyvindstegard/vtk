  Provides a command based management interface to the system.

  <h3>Shell like management interfaces</h3>

    This package contains scripting and shell interfaces to the
    system. Such interfaces can be useful for tasks such as
    management, debugging, etc, as they have complete access to the
    bean factory of Spring. The scripting objects must be hooked up
    into Spring as beans themselves. Currently, support for <a
    href="http://www.beanshell.org" target="_top">BeanShell</a> has
    been added. 

  <h3>Operation</h3>

    The scripting components in this implementation are centered
    around the class {@link org.vortikal.shell.AbstractConsole
    AbstractConsole}. This class offers pluggable support for
    different interpreters. The console has an optional switch for
    either running one pass on startup and then exiting, or running in
    a "read-eval-print" loop in a separate thread (must be a subclass
    of {@link ShellHandlerThread}).

    The default implementation of ShellHandlerThread used by
    AbstractConsole is {@link ConsoleHandlerThread}, which reads and
    outputs commands and results to the console. The
    ConsoleHandlerThread works with a {@link CommandReader} and a
    {@link java.io.PrintStream}, executing commands as shown below:

    <pre>
      ----------------
     |                |  1. read command
     | CommandReader  |--------------
     |                |              |
      ----------------            -------------   2.evaluate   -------------
                                 |             |  ----------> |             |
                                 |  Thread     | <----------  | Interpreter |
                                 |             |              |             |
      ----------------            -------------                -------------
     |                |              |
     | PrintStream    |--------------
     |                |  3. print result
      ----------------
    </pre>

    The command reader and the PrintStream are configurable properties
    of the ConsoleHandlerThread class, allowing for commands to be
    read from various sources such as pipes, files, etc. The default
    implementation uses the console for input and System.out for
    output.

  <h3>Init files</h3>

    The AbstractConsole class (and consequently its subclasses)
    supports setting an <code>initFiles</code> property. Setting this
    property to a list of resources will cause the shell to evaluate
    each one on startup. This may be useful for making custom
    functions, scripts, etc. available to the interpreter. The init
    files are located using the Spring
    framework's <code>ResourceLoader</code> framework, and
    supports <code>classpath:</code> type locators in addition to
    standard URLs.

  <h3>Bindings</h3>

  The bean context is provided as a binding in the interpreter, under
  the name <code>context</code>. This allows scripts script to operate
  on other beans, e.g.
  <pre>
    repository = context.getBean("...");
    repository.move(...);
    ...
    etc.
  </pre>
  

  <h3>Example</h3>

    A very simple Spring XML configuration of a BeanShell interpreter,
    reading from and writing to the console, and having an init script
    called <code>foo.bsh</code> somewhere in the classpath, would be:

    <pre>
      &lt;bean id="console" class="org.vortikal.shell.BeanShellManager"&gt; 
          &lt;property name="initFiles"&gt;
              &lt;list&gt;
                 &lt;value&gt;classpath:foo.bsh&lt;/value&gt;
              &lt;/list&gt;
          &lt;/property&gt;
      &lt;/bean&gt;
    </pre>
    Note: when using interpreters reading from the console
    (System.in), only one instance may be created (obviously).
