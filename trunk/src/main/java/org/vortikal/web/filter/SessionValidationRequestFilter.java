/**
 * Provides a minimum of protection against session hijacking.
 * Upon session creation the client address is stored in the session, 
 * and this address is validated against the request address on every call 
 * to <code>getSession()</code>. If the two addresses do not match, the 
 * session is invalidated. 
 * 
 * <p>In case of a session hijack attempt, using this filter may 
 * cause the valid session to be invalidated (servlet container dependent). 
 * This is unfortunate, but still better than allowing an attacker to steal 
 * the session.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Of course, this filter does not offer any protection against IP spoofing, 
 * nor does it work if both clients are behind the same IP.</p>
